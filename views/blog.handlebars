                This state park is located a short distance outside of Salina
                Kansas. It has a great area for camping with horses. Most
                camping sites have full electrical and water hook ups for your
                convenience. There are great trails to ride although you have to
                ride a few miles before getting to the good stuff. There are
                canyons to ride through, water crossings to cross and wooded
                areas to get out of the sun.
